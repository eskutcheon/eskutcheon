- 👋 Hi, I'm a graduate student in computational science at MS State University
- 👀 I’m interested in applied mathematics and mathematical programming, scientific computing, data science, machine learning, and all things analysis
- 🌱 I consider myself most proficient in Python, though I've dabbled with C/C++, Java, MATLAB, R, C#, Javascript, and (when I'm forced to) Pascal and Fortran
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all cool projects so I can keep developing myself as a programmer, mathematician, and ML engineer while getting better at DevOps
- 📫 How to reach me: jkutch326@tutanota.com
