- 👋 Hi, I'm a graduate student in computational science at MS State University
- 👀 I’m interested in applied mathematics and mathematical programming, scientific computing, data science, machine learning, and all things analysis
- 🌱 I consider myself most proficient in Python, though I've dabbled with C/C++, Java, MATLAB, R, C#, Javascript, and (when I'm forced to) Pascal and Fortran
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all cool projects so I can keep developing myself as a programmer, mathematician, and ML engineer while getting better at DevOps
- 📫 How to reach me: jkutch326@tutanota.com

NOTE: My Github probably looks pretty sparse because for a long time, I've been bad about using git in any given project. Also, as my focus became more mathematically-oriented, the code for many school projects became more atomized and often included mostly simple scripts. I'm getting better with DevOps now and intend to push many old projects when time permits.
